I felt a lack of new episodes from [Seiya Dev.](https://github.com/seiya-dev/)'s client compared to the YouTube channel, so here I go trying to get it up to date!
Don't expect it to be constant, but I won't mind checking a pull request!

# The branches
The *sandbox* contains more content than released and will probably have unfinished content, so expect nonfunctioning or malfunctioning episodes. The content will be finished from there and then sent to the *nightly* branch, which will be merged with *master*.
