![A cartoon television with an eary orange creature with yellow cheeks, eyes, tiny nose and mouth inside. Its ears stick out. At the right of the screen stands the text REVIVOKÉMON in low caps italic.](https://github.com/OldGuy111/revivokemon/blob/wipepisodes/revivokemon.png)

I felt a lack of new episodes from [Seiya Dev.](https://github.com/seiya-dev/)'s client compared to the YouTube channel, so here I go trying to get it up to date!
Don't expect it to be constant, but I won't mind checking a pull request!
