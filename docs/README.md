![A cartoon television with an eary orange creature with yellow cheeks, eyes, tiny nose and mouth inside. Its ears stick out. At the right of the screen stands the text REVIVOKÉMON in low caps italic.](https://github.com/OldGuy111/revivokemon/blob/master/revivokemon.png)

This is a Pokémon TV clone focused on thumbnail accuracy, access to series, specials and children's content and multiplatform support.

I will add content progressively.

# The branches
The *sandbox* contains more content than released and will probably have unfinished content, so expect nonfunctioning or malfunctioning episodes. The content will be finished from there and then sent to the *nightly* branch, which will be merged with *master*.
