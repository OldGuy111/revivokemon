![A cartoon television with an eary orange creature with yellow cheeks, eyes, tiny nose and mouth inside. Its ears stick out. At the right of the screen stands the text REVIVOKÉMON in low caps italic.](https://github.com/OldGuy111/revivokemon/blob/master/revivokemon.png)

The objective of this project is to not only reunite the available episodes of Pokémon: The Series, but also the specials and children's content available on YouTube on one single easy-to-access place.
Don't expect it to be constant, but I won't mind checking a pull request!


# The branches
The *sandbox* contains more content than released and will probably have unfinished content, so expect nonfunctioning or malfunctioning episodes. The content will be finished from there and then sent to the *nightly* branch, which will be merged with *master*.
